# SFLANG Operators

There are several valid operators in SFLANG. The obvious ones are:

```
a + b;
a - b;
a / b;
a * b;
```

where `a` and `b` are the same type and are either `Float`, `Long` or `Int`. 

We also have bit operations.

```
a << b;
a >> b;
a | b;
a & b;
a ^ b;
~a; 
```

Then, boolean operations:

```
a && b;
a || b;
!a;
```
